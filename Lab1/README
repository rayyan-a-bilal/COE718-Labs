The purpose of this lab was to provide an introduction to the Keil uVision IDE, the ARM Cortex M3
architecture as well as other various features. The lab provides an in depth guide for the fundamental steps
to coding, compiling and executing a program on the M3 processor on the NXP LPC1768
microcontroller. This chip on the MCB1700 development board will allow debugging and running simple
embedded programs. The lab also focuses on how to simulate and analyze the lab results. The skills
acquired through this lab will be highly valuable in real-world embedded development scenarios, given
that ARM-based processors are widely used in embedded systems for their low power consumption and
competitive performance.
